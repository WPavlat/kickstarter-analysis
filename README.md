# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project we created several worksheets and charts documenting and highlighting the differences and outcomes of various Kickstarter campaigns.

### Purpose
The general goals of this analysis were to sort the data into more relevant and distinguishable sub-catagories, and then to help visualize some of trends that were present in the narrowed data set.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this table and chart, we look at how the month the campaign was launched in correlates to its success or failure. I used a pivot table to create counts for the outcomes of the campaigns per month, and then this line graph corrosponding tot that data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this worksheet with graph, we look how the initial fundraising goal of a kickstarter campaign correlated to to its success or failure. We also converted these statistics to percentages for a clearer understanding of the data. The corresponding graph shows us how campaigns within certain goal windows performed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
With the graphs used, the axes were not set out in an optimal way by Excel by default. So these had to have the data reassigned to different axes. 

## Results

From the *Outcomes based on Launch Date* chart and graph we can conclude that:
1. The month of May and the following three months have a higher quantity of Theatre Kickstarter campaigns launched.
2. The month of May also has the highest quantity and proportion of successful Kickstarter campaigns, while December has the lowest. 

From the *Outcomes based on Goals* chart and graph we can conclude that Theatre Kickstarters with fundraising goals of <$1000 to $5000 or from $35,000 to $45,000 have the most favorable rates of success, and anything above that is likely unfeasable.

### Data Set Limitations

This Data Set tells us nothing about the creators and associates behind these campaigns. Were they successful in previous Kickstarters or in projects backed via traditional funding? Can large amounts of the failed or successful campaigns be linked to single creators/teams?

Additionally, the data does not give us much insight into the promotional methods used by the various campaigns other than whether they were 'spotlighted' or picked by the staff. 

### Additional Charting

Given that they are the only pertinent data to the promotion of the Kickstarters that we have, it would be interesting to see the relationships between those campaigns which were 'spotlighted' or picked by the staff, and the relative success of those kickstarters. A table that specifically tabulates the outcomes of campaigns based on these variables could be insightful.
